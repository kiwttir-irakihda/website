			            <h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Research Intern </h3>
			            <p>
			            	I was working with Advanced Manufacturing Automation (AMA) team. As an intern, I was working on Siemens SIMATIC NPU module. The NPU or Neural Processing Unit serves as the brain and sensory organ of any automation tasks. With the NPU we can take input from a camera via USB and run algorithms which may need machine learning. The NPU can make decisions and can also relays commands to actuators. Working on the NPU, I worked on the internal Intel Myriad X architecture and used Computer Vision to devise solutions on the NPU.

						<h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Research Intern </h3>
			            <p>
							Project Minions is a interactive AR/VR game where the user can adopt a virtual minion and feed it via games and coins. I headed in the Point Cloud team of seven members. Our objective was to fingerprint and identify a room in a building. Once we fingerprinted the room we can move around the virtual room using SLAM.

						<h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Associate Software Engineer</h3>
			            <p>
							When a hacker wants to hack into an organization, it isn't done in a few days. It needs months of plannning, and scouring for vulnerabilities to the system. Once it gains access, it hides itself until D-Day of a hack. This form of threat is called an Advanced Persistent Threat. FireEye is a computer security company which is on the forefront of monitoring such hacks across the world. One of FireEye's products to detect these threats is its forensic product xAgent.</p>
						<p>
							As an engineer at FireEye, I worked as a tester for the xAgent software. My duties and resposibilities involved developing automated test scripts to ensure functioning of the xAgent. It sometimes involved making changes to the system and checking if xAgent was able to detect the change.

						<h2 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">National Instruments LabVIEW team - Bangalore, India</h2>
						<h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Software Developer Intern </h3>
			            <p>
							LabVIEW is National Instrument's graphical programming language. It uses the input from its hardware products and it either displays the result or enables some action. LabVIEW has an expensive license, and it may not be used by everyone. So it may be better for users to just view the code and make comments. As an intern I developed a web viewer for LabVIEW which just provides a basic viewer for Virtual Instruments and Packages. The project won NITech Week in Bangalore and was further showcased to NI based conferences worldwide.

							Spectrum Labs, Indian Institute of Science - Bangalore, India
						</h2>
						<h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Research Intern </h3>
			            <p>
							Spectrum Labs is the brainchild of Prof. Chandrasekhar Seelamantula. Sir and his team work on applying Signal Processing and Computer Vision in solving today's problems. One of the fields where Spectrum Labs is making an impact is biomedical imaging. Under the guidance of my professor, I had developed an iOS application to take the fundus image of a patient and diagnose whether the patient had glaucoma or not. The application was very helpful as it reduces the time taken by the doctor to make a diagnosis to mere seconds. The app had undergone clinical trials in the Manipal hospital bangalore.
						</p>

						<p>
							While working in the lab, I have also developed a image segmentation tool in imageJ called iShapes. iShapes is an ImageJ plugin to provide segmentation for generic images. iShapes provides tools for delineation of lungs, corpus collosum, optic disc and cells.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I have also done my Bachelors thesis in IISc under sir. I had implemented a software to capture movements of lecturers in classrooms using deep neural networks. Algorithm focuses on human tracking irrespective of illumination, noise and occlusion. The system used Intel's Movidius Neuro Compute Stick to detect and move the camera to focus on the professor.
